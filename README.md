# fibonacci

Hello and welcome back!

This is a simple fibonacci sequence generator written in C#. You can choose how long you want the sequence to be and it gets printed to the textbox with an according indicator at which place the number would be in the sequence.

This little program was written just for fun and because it helps me learn C# and winforms.

It's a hobby project and just for learning purposes.
